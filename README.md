## My humble website

This is my humble website a created with CRA.

## Installation

```yarn install```

## Running

```yarn start```

## Testing

```yarn test```

## Deploying

Make sure you have `netlify-cli` installed globally and already logged in with your netlify account through the command `netlify login` this will open netlify login/authorization to create a link between the project and netlify.
After this little proccess just run:

```yarn deploy```
