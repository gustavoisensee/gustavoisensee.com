# My humble website

This is my humble website created with CRA.

## Installation

```
yarn install
```

## Running

```
yarn start
```

## Testing

```
yarn test
```

## Deploying

Make sure you have `netlify-cli` installed globally and already logged in with your netlify account through the command `netlify login`, this will open netlify login/authorization in a browser to create a link between the project and netlify.
After this proccess just run:

```
yarn deploy:preview
```
To deploy to preview version with different and temporary URL which will be displayed in the console.

```
yarn deploy
```
To deploy to production.
